## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I decided to go with Bootstrap 5 to familiarize with it's components and to practise using it in real project. I used card component and grid to get responsive layout. It allowed me to create default aggangement of particular components.

I had some difficulties with Bootstrap default breakpoints - sass mixins wouldn't work with my stylesheets - so I decided to use standard css media queries instead.

### Continued development

I would like to solve problems with sass mixins related with Bootstrap breakpoints.
